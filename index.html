<H2><u>Instructions</u></H2>
    <ul> 
        <li>Preheat oven to 180 degrees celcius and line a 9Ã—9 inch pan with nonstick foil or baking paper. In a large microwave safe bowl, microwave dark chocolate chips for 1 1/2-2 minutes, allow to rest for a couple of minutes before stirring until smooth. </li>
        
        <li>Add butter, sugars, vanilla, and eggs and mix well. Whisk in flour, salt, and cocoa powder until incorporated. Stir in milk chocolate chips.</li>
        
        <li>Transfer batter to prepared pan and bake for 35-40 minutes. *For chewier brownies, cook a little longer, closer to 40-42 minutes. For fudgier, gooey brownies, a little less cooking time, closer to 35. </li>
        
        <li>Serve immediately with ice cream and hot fudge sauce, or allow to cool completely (best for ultra chewy brownies) before cutting into squares and serving. If you like the chewier texture but still want to serve them warm with ice cream, you can pop them in the microwave individually for about 20 seconds to heat them up. </li>
     </ul>
